## Methylene Blue

**Press release from the jellyfish FDA:**  
Methylene blue has now been approved (by me and Brady) for use to treat polyp *Aplanochytrium* infection.

Additional sequencing data from System 1 and the Iwaki system confirmed the presence of abundant *Aplanochytrium* in affected and dead, but not healthy, stolon samples, so this protozoan is confirmed as present in our diseased colonies. However, please note that there are many other types of organisms and conditions that can also affect polyp health.

At least 5 slides have now been treated with methylene blue. When used at a concentration of 2.3 ppm (e.g. 1 ml of 2.3% Kordon methylene blue solution in 10 liters of AccuraSea seawater), methylene blue is safe and effective. Treat for 3â€“5 days, according to manufacturer's instructions. Colonies recover and grow well in methylene blue water, and continue to thrive and remain free of *Aplanochytrium* for weeks afterwards. When polyps are treated in a non-recirculating tank, a water pump should be used for water flow over the polyps, and feeding should be done by hand in small dishes.

**Common side effects include:** persistent blue coloration (especially of polyp heads and growth cones) for multiple weeks, removal of much of the biofilm covering the slides. Long-term effects on polyps and potentially medusae are unknown.

**Off-label use** to treat other polyp conditions is not yet approved, but should be safe if done properly.  
Ask your jellyfish doctor if methylene blue is right for your polyps.
